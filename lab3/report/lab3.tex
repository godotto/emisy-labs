\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Brief description}
Laboratory's main purpose was to learn how to use switches and keyboard matrices
with microcontrollers and its peripherals. Once again tasks had to be done
in the EdSim5 simulator.

\subsection{Hardware description}
Microcontroller (Atmelâ€™s AT89C4051) is connected to 5 V source and is equipped with 12 MHz clock and simple resetting circuit.
LCD screen's data bus is connected to P1 port. Display's RS and E pins are
connected to P3.0 and P3.1 pins, respectively. Switch button SW0 from switch
bank is connected to P2.0 pin.

\section*{Declaration of authorship}
I declare that this piece of work which is the basis for recognition of achieving learning outcomes in the EMISY course was completed on my own.
