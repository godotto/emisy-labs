\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Brief description}
Laboratory's main purpose was to learn how to use switches and keyboard matrices
with microcontrollers and its peripherals. Once again tasks had to be done
in the EdSim5 simulator.

\subsection{Hardware description}
Microcontroller (Atmelâ€™s AT89C4051) is connected to 5 V source and is equipped with 12 MHz clock and simple resetting circuit.
LCD screen's data bus is connected to P1 port. Display's RS and E pins are
connected to P3.0 and P3.1 pins, respectively. Switch button SW0 from switch
bank is connected to P2.0 pin.

\subsection{Code description}
\emph{Part of description is from the lab 1}\\
Program starts with constants definition. In order to make the code more readable,
pins has been assigned to mnemonic names. Then the main routine starts with display
initialization. Assigning immiediate value to the register and decrementing it makes
a simple loop which is required for delay. In the beginning microcontroller has to wait
for display at least 30 miliseconds (in order to get proper voltage on display).
Program calls \texttt{long\_delay} subroutine 20 times in order to wait this amount of time.

\texttt{long\_delay} decrements number 256 to zero three times. It gives
appoximately 1.53 ms (even more than this). This number is not coincidence -- such delay
will be used later when several characters will be printed on display.

After 30 ms of delay data bus is filled with value responsible for function set. 
Display has to be set to two line mode. Then command is being sent by \texttt{send\_command}
subroutine. It clears RS pin as command is being sent, not data about character. In the end
it sets and then clears E pin. It is a signal for display to get data from data bus. The last
step is a short delay before the next command. \texttt{short\_delay} subroutine
is even simpler than \texttt{long\_delay}. It only decrements to zero value of 18.
It results in delay of more than 39 $\mu$s which is necessary after executing each display's command.

The next command is responsible for turning on the display and showing cursor. It is executed
in the same manner as function set. The last step in initialization process is entering
set mode. It is set to increment mode, so characters are appearing one after the other.

When initialization is finished, program clears the screen and waits in the loop until
the push button is being pressed. When button is pressed, pin is grounded, so program has to
exit the loop when SW bit is cleared.

If program exits the loop, it is writing letters into display's DDRAM (staring from the first postiton of the first line).
Letter's code is written to the data bus and \texttt{send\_data} is called.
It works almost in the same way as \texttt{send\_command}, the only difference is that
it sets R/S pin to turn on writing mode.

After printing all letters, program stays in the another loop. This time it waits for setting
the SW pin which is of course being set after releasing the button. When program exits the loop
it goes back to not\_pressed label when screen is cleared and once again waits for clearing the SW pin.

\subsection{Code description}
In the beginning macros are being set up and program immiediately jumps to initialization subroutine.
It enables global interrupts and enables INT1 external interrupt, whose pin is connected to the
output of AND gate. Gates inputs are matrix's column pins. Finally, INT1 is set to detect falling edge
and matrix's port is set in a way to clear all row pins. Without the last step keyboard matrix
would not work properly.

Then program waits for an interrupt in the infinite loop. Interrupt happens when
any key is pressed. In the interrupt handler subroutine XOR operation with 1 is operated on
LED pin. With this instruction every handler execution will alter the pin's value.
